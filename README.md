# Blackjack
Play blackjack with computer! Standard 21 bust, stand on 17.

# Files

There are a total of 4 files. They are:
1. main.py: this file is what you run and it calls all the appropriate main modules
2. player.py: contains the player class which both user and dealer are part of. Runs necessary computations and stores relevant information like player's hand.
3. blackjack.py: here you will find the actual game and this is where input from user is requested and winning conditions are met and visualized
4. utils.py: supplementary modules make up this file. Some of these modules are called often and others aren't. They aren't really the core of the game mechanics, however they are vital for the playability of the game.

# Dependencies

Only two libraries are used: itertools and random, and they are both part of the the standard python library. So if you have python you should have these two libraries.

# Run program

Open up your terminal interface. Make sure you have directed into the folder "FreenomeCodingChallenge". Then from there just type "python main.py" and it will run the program.
